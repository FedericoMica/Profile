    <p>I am not working or plan to work alongside my studies, I am thinking of going to America over summer break to get a job that my brother can offer me. In my spare time I usually just relax and do what I want or I read a book and learn mroe about my study if I am confused/behind. I can combine this with my study by using some spare time to focus and get ahead.</p>
